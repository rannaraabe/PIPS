Difficulty: Easy;

Lena is preparing for an important coding competition that is preceded by a number of sequential preliminary contests. Initially, her luck balance is 0. She believes in "saving luck", and wants to check her theory. Each contest is described by two integers, L[i] and T[i]:
L[i] is the amount of luck associated with a contest. If Lena wins the contest, her luck balance will decrease by L[i]; if she loses it, her luck balance will increase by L[i].
T[i] denotes the contest's importance rating. It's equal to 1 if the contest is important, and it's equal to 0 if it's unimportant.
If Lena loses no more than k important contests, what is the maximum amount of luck she can have after competing in all the preliminary contests? This value may be negative.

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 100
0 <= k <= N
1 <= L[i] <= 10^4
T[i] âˆˆ {0, 1}
