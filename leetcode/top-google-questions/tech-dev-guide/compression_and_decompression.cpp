Difficulty: -;

In this exercise, you're going to decompress a compressed string.
Your input is a compressed string of the format number[string] and the decompressed output form should be the string written number times. For example:

The input: 3[abc]4[ab]c
Would be output as: abcabcabcababababc

Other rules:
- Number can have more than one digit. For example, 10[a] is allowed, and just means aaaaaaaaaa
- One repetition can occur inside another. For example, 2[3[a]b] decompresses into aaabaaab
- Characters allowed as input include digits, small English letters and brackets [ ].
- Digits are only to represent amount of repetitions.
- Letters are just letters.
- Brackets are only part of syntax of writing repeated substring.
- Input is always valid, so no need to check its validity.

Learning objectives:
This question gives you the chance to practice with strings, recursion, algorithm, compilers, automata, and loops. It’s also an opportunity to work on coding with better efficiency.

Constraints:
-
